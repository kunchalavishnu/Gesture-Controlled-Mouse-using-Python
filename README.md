# Gesture-Controlled-Mouse-using-Python
A Gesture Controlled Mouse lets you control a computer using hand gestures instead of a physical mouse. It uses a camera to track hand movements, Python libraries like OpenCV to process video, and translates gestures into actions like moving the cursor or clicking. Itâ€™s a creative way to build touch-free user interfaces and explore AI.
